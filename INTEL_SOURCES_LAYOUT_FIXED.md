# Intel Sources Layout Fix - COMPLETED

## Problem
The FILTER dropdown in the Intel Sources section was poorly positioned compared to VIEW and SORT controls. The three controls (VIEW, SORT, FILTER) were not evenly spaced and didn't fit properly within their container.

## Root Cause
The CSS used a rigid 3-column grid (`grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr`) but the FILTER control was conditionally rendered. This created layout inconsistencies:

- When FILTER was shown: 3 controls in a 3-column grid (worked okay)
- When FILTER was hidden: 2 controls in a 3-column grid (poor spacing)
- The dropdowns had inconsistent width constraints

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Flexible Layout System
Changed from rigid grid to flexible layout:

```css
/* Before: Rigid 3-column grid */
.controls-row {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
}

/* After: Flexible layout */
.controls-row {
  display: flex;
  gap: var(--spacing-sm);
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

### 2. Consistent Control Sizing
Added uniform sizing constraints to control groups:

```css
.view-controls,
.sort-controls,
.category-controls {
  flex: 1;
  min-width: 80px;
  max-width: 120px;
}
```

### 3. Dropdown Width Standardization
Standardized dropdown widths for consistent appearance:

```css
.intel-select {
  width: 100%;
  min-width: 70px;
}
```

## Results
✅ **Even Spacing**: All three controls (VIEW, SORT, FILTER) are now evenly spaced
✅ **Consistent Sizing**: All dropdowns have uniform width and height
✅ **Flexible Layout**: Works with 2 or 3 controls dynamically
✅ **Proper Alignment**: Controls align properly within their container
✅ **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to content changes

## File Modified
- `/src/assets/styles/tactical-ui.css` - Updated `.controls-row`, control group classes, and `.intel-select` styling

## Visual Impact
The Intel Sources control panel now has a clean, tactical interface appearance with perfectly aligned VIEW, SORT, and FILTER controls that maintain consistent spacing and sizing regardless of conditional display state.
