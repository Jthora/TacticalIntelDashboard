## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### DiagnosticService Architecture
```typescript
interface DiagnosticResult {
  timestamp: Date;
  type: 'scan' | 'clean' | 'repair';
  status: 'success' | 'warning' | 'error';
  issues: HealthIssue[];
  metrics: HealthMetrics;
  recommendations: string[];
  duration: number;
  itemsFixed?: number;
  itemsRemaining?: number;
}

interface HealthIssue {
  id: string;
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  category: 'performance' | 'connectivity' | 'data' | 'security';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  solution?: string;
  autoFixable: boolean;
  component?: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### Operational Flow
1. **System Scan**: 
   - Identifies issues across multiple categories
   - Gathers performance metrics
   - Generates recommendations
   - Updates overall system status

2. **System Clean**:
   - Targets cleanable issues (data, performance)
   - Simulates cleanup operations
   - Provides success/failure feedback
   - Updates health metrics

3. **System Repair**:
   - Addresses all repairable issues
   - Higher success rate than cleaning
   - Comprehensive problem resolution
   - Detailed operation reporting
