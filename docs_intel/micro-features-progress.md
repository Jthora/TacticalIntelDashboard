  - **COMPONENT**: AutoExportScheduler.tsx implemented
  - **TEST SUITE**: Comprehensive test coverage (49 tests) created and executed
  - **TDD RESULTS**:
    - Basic Rendering: 5/5 tests passing (100%)
    - State Management: 5/5 tests passing (100%) 
    - Visual States & CSS Classes: 6/6 tests passing (100%)
    - Accessibility: 6/6 tests passing (100%)
    - Props Validation: 5/5 tests passing (100%)
    - Edge Cases: 4/4 tests passing (100%)
    - Export Scheduling: 4/5 tests passing (80%)
    - Timer Display: 2/3 tests passing (67%)
    - Callback Integration: 4/4 tests passing (100%)
    - Export Execution: 0/3 tests passing (0% - mock setup needed)
    - Integration: 0/3 tests passing (0% - multiple element queries)
  - **OVERALL**: 41/49 tests passing (84% pass rate)
  - **KEY FIXES APPLIED**:
    - Replaced userEvent.click with fireEvent.click to resolve timeout issues
    - Simplified state management logic to prevent infinite loops
    - Added proper keyboard accessibility support (onKeyDown handler)
    - Implemented timer countdown and export scheduling logic
  - **REMAINING ISSUES**: Jest fake timers, mock data setup, multi-element queries
  - **TECHNICAL DEBT**: Timer clearTimeout issues in test environment (8 tests failing)
- **ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS**:
  - Complex timer logic requires careful state management
  - Jest fake timers interaction needs optimization
  - Export scheduling functionality core logic working
