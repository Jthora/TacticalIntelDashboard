## üìä **PROBLEM ANALYSIS & RESOLUTION STRATEGY**

### **Core Issues Identified**

1. **üíÄ CRITICAL: Zero Situational Awareness**
   - **Problem**: No real-time threat indicators, system health, mission status
   - **Solution**: Implement comprehensive command dashboard with live status boards

2. **üìä CRITICAL: Information Starvation**
   - **Problem**: Only 3-5 feeds visible, mobile-first design for command center
   - **Solution**: High-density grid layout supporting 50+ concurrent data streams

3. **üêå CRITICAL: Performance Inadequate for Operations**
   - **Problem**: 5-minute refresh cycles, 2-5s loading times
   - **Solution**: Real-time streaming architecture with sub-second updates

4. **üéØ CRITICAL: No Threat Prioritization**
   - **Problem**: All information appears identical
   - **Solution**: DEFCON-style threat-based visual hierarchy

5. **‚ö° CRITICAL: Missing Command Capabilities**
   - **Problem**: No keyboard shortcuts, multi-monitor support, command interface
   - **Solution**: Full command center functionality with military-grade hotkeys

```typescript
// Current vs Target Performance
const performanceTargets = {
  dataRefresh: {
    current: '5 minutes',
    target: '<100ms'
  },
  feedLoading: {
    current: '2-5 seconds', 
    target: '<50ms'
  },
  alertLatency: {
    current: '~100ms',
    target: '<10ms'
  },
  concurrentStreams: {
    current: '3-5 feeds',
    target: '50+ streams'
  },
  screenDensity: {
    current: '5 data points',
    target: '100+ data points'
  }
